#@@ Create a subdirectory, generate a makefile with new contents, and execute make command.
#@ This code snippet creates a subdirectory "subdir", generates a makefile with new contents, and then executes the make command within the subdirectory. The new contents are passed as a variable "new_contents" and are processed using the sed command to remove leading spaces before writing to the makefile. After creating the makefile, its contents are displayed, and then the make command is executed within the subdirectory.
all:
	mkdir -p subdir
	echo $(new_contents) | sed -e 's/^ //' > subdir/makefile
	@echo "---MAKEFILE CONTENTS---"
	@cd subdir && cat makefile
	@echo "---END MAKEFILE CONTENTS---"
	cd subdir && $(MAKE)
