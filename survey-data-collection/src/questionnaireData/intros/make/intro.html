    The purpose of this part of the questionnaire is to assess the documentation generation for the Make language.
  </p>

  <p>In general, a makefile contains rules of the form:</p>
  <div class="overflow-auto rounded-md border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 mb-4">
    <pre class="language-bash"><code>target : prerequisites
    recipe</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>
    where <code>target</code> is the name of a file, <code>prerequisites</code> are the dependencies of the file (if any), and <code>recipe</code> is the sequence of shell commands.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many of our examples contain “phony” targets, where the <code>target</code> is not a file name, but instead serves as a name for the recipe. For phony targets, the list of dependencies often is empty (meaning that the target is always out‑of‑date).
  </p>

  <p>Below is a header comment for a rule with a phony target called <code>do-push</code>:</p>
  <div class="overflow-auto rounded-md border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 mb-4">
    <pre class="language-bash"><code>#@@ Pushes Docker image to a repository with version and latest tags if conditions are met.
#@ The "do-push" command pushes the Docker image with the specified version tag to the repository. If the "TAG_WITH_LATEST" variable is not set to "never" and either set to "always" or the "BASE_RELEASE" matches the "VERSION", it also pushes the image with the "latest" tag.
do-push:
    docker push $(IMAGE):$(VERSION)
    @if [[ $(TAG_WITH_LATEST) != never ]] && ([[ $(TAG_WITH_LATEST) == always ]] || [[ $(BASE_RELEASE) == $(VERSION) ]]); then \
        echo docker push $(IMAGE):latest >&2; \
        docker push $(IMAGE):latest; \
    fi</code></pre>
  </div>

  <p>
    Here, the header comment contains a short description (prefixed <code>#@@</code>) and a longer description (prefixed <code>#@</code>).
